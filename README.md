## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that allows users to calculate earnings from a mutual fund. Our goal is to provide a fun interactive way to visualize the growth of funds, and also to educate users on the importance of investing early.

## Usage
Users will enter the principal, appreciation, monthly contribution, and years invested. Additionally, users may enter a percent of depreciation if they want to account for factors like inflation. The website will then generate a graph showing the growth of their imaginary funds over the given period of time.  

## Tools Utilized
- **Programming Languages:** Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Frameworks:** React, Spring Boot 
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Hosting:** Github Pages 

## Problems Encountered and Solutions
1. **Sending Data:**
   - **Problem:** Initial difficulty sending data/ utilizing methods from the backend to the frontend/backend to the frontend.
   - **Solution:** The team used a file to save data and format it as a JSON for frontend to read.

2. **Creating JSON Objects:**
   - **Problem:** JSON objects had too much information and was difficult for frontend coders to re compile.
   - **Solution:** Created a new class that stores key values to make it easier to store data sent to front end as JSON objects.

3. **Collaboration:**
   - **Problem:** Struggled finding best means of working on the same class at once. Originally used Microsoft live server, but struggled with program crashing a 
   code being lost.
   - **Solution:** Turned to simply forking code from GitHub Repo to VSCode. Overcame issues of interfering with others' progress by clearly communicating what 
   changes were being made.

## Public Frameworks Utilized
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - A Java framework for building stand-alone, production-ready applications.
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - A Java build automation tool and dependency management system.
